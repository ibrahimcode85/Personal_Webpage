            Closing the 2025 DNF Project — A Season in Review
          </div>
          <div class="date">31 Dec 2025</div>
          <div class="intro-text">
            <p>
              2025 marked the end of my focused DNF project — a year built
              around structured training, competition exposure, and steady
              progression. Throughout the year, training milestones gradually
              moved from breaking 125m, to 133m, and later reaching 137m and
              139m, each distance reinforcing both confidence and consistency
              rather than chasing one-off performances.
            </p>

            <p>
              The season included five competitions across the year, including
              overseas events in Singapore and Japan. One of the highlights was
              representing Malaysia at the AIDA Pool World Championship in
              Wakayama, an experience that brought together everything learned
              throughout the season under a different competitive environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              By the end of the year, the accumulated performances placed me 3rd
              on the all-time DNF ranking in Malaysia, and 3rd overall for pool
              competitions in 2025. More than the rankings themselves, the year
              served as a clear closing chapter — a reference point for progress
              made and lessons learned.
            </p>

            <p>
              Looking ahead, the focus remains on deepening mastery in DNF while
              gradually shifting attention towards DYN. The intention is to
              continue maturing as a freediver — valuing efficiency, awareness,
              and composure over numbers alone, and allowing performance to
              emerge naturally from a more complete and balanced practice.
