            Competed in a freediving competition held in Penang—a memorable
            experience, as it was my first time diving in a 50m pool and also my
            first time experiencing a blackout during a dive (I was fasting at
            the time). Although I was disqualified on Day 1 for my 109m attempt
            due to the blackout, I’m glad I managed to update my official
            no-fins record to 96m the next day. It was also great to reconnect
            with friends I met during my last trip to Penang for the DNF
            workshop.
